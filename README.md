# 🎧 Audio Modem – Text Transmission via Sound

This project implements a basic **Audio Modem** using **Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)** to transmit short text messages over sound. The system encodes a message into an audio waveform and decodes it back into text from a `.wav` file.

## 📘 Assignment Description

**Exercise 1 (Audio Modem - not SDR-based):**

Design and implement a communication system that:
- Accepts a short text string (8–32 bytes).
- Converts the text into audio (modulation).
- Saves the audio to a `.wav` file.
- Optionally plays the audio to be received via microphone.
- Decodes the `.wav` back into text (demodulation).
- Demonstrates correct end-to-end transmission.
- Is submitted via GitHub.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo and navigate into the folder.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### 🔹 Transmit a Message

```bash
python transmit.py
```

- Enter the message when prompted.
- Generates `output.wav` with the FSK-modulated signal.

### 🔹 (Optional) Play the Audio

Use any audio player (e.g., VLC) or your system's default player to play `output.wav`.

### 🔹 Decode the Message

```bash
python receive.py
```

- This reads `output.wav` and prints the decoded message.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

- **Modulation**: Uses two tones: 1200 Hz for `0`, 2200 Hz for `1`.
- **Sampling Rate**: 44100 Hz
- **Bit Duration**: 0.1 seconds (10 bits/sec)

## ✅ Example

```bash
$ python transmit.py
Enter message to transmit: Hello
[✓] Audio saved to output.wav

$ python receive.py
[⏳] Decoding from output.wav...
[🧩] Raw bits: 0100100001100101011011000110110001101111
[📥] Decoded message: Hello
```

## 💡 Notes

- For best results, ensure minimal background noise if playing and recording through speakers/microphone.
- Alternatively, decode directly from the generated `.wav` file.
- You can extend the system to include start/stop bits, checksums, or noise filtering.
